# About FinReg Foundry

## Regulatory Knowledge in the Digital Age

FinReg Foundry is an advisory firm that combines traditional advice with digital artifacts that make regulatory knowledge accessible at scale in compliance, software development, and data science processes
We focus on the twin challenges of complexity in the regulatory environment and inside operating or proposed financial institutions – and how to make technology designed to help with these challenges work better. We provide knowledge and artifacts to support regulatory obligations management, activities and structure compliance, RegTech product development, and GRC solutions.

We bring to our engagements a rare blend of first-tier regulatory knowledge, industry operational experience, and deep engagement with state-of-the-art technology. Our clients include financial institutions, law firms, RegTech software companies, and GRC systems integrators. We pride ourselves on the ability to bridge the gap between compliance officers and regulatory lawyers on one hand and engineers, product managers, and data scientists on the other.

## Deliverables with Capabilities

A FinReg Foundry artifact is an advisory deliverable that encapsulates regulatory knowledge and know-how in a form that conveys capabilities as well as knowledge.
Artifacts transform regulatory knowledge into operational tools that directly support compliance and technology processes in a format that works with existing systems and IT policies. Some artifacts are tools for end-users, while others are tools for the toolmakers. Either way, artifacts surgically inject knowledge that clients can leverage.

Rather than a hammer in search of a nail, the FinReg Foundry method is inherently flexible, capable of casting the same patterns into many different forms. Templates, toolkits, collaboration workspaces, wikis, calculators, taxonomies, document generators, domain models, requirements documents, design patterns, configuration files, knowledge graphs, datasets, fine-tuned language models, temporary no-code web apps — our focus is on finding the right tool for the job.
